# AI-Powered Legal Assistant

## Description
This web app provides an AI-powered legal assistant where users can upload PDF legal documents and ask questions related to the content. The app processes the document using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and provides relevant answers using the Google Gemini API.

The application utilizes FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient document retrieval and Hugging Face embeddings for transforming the text data into numerical vectors. Users can interact with the app via a simple web interface built with Streamlit.
